# 2016 Oregon State University Computer Science II Final Project
The Final Project for my Computer Science II course taken at Oregon State University

## Description
This Program is a text-based game using Object Oriented Programming design principles in C++. It includes a Reflection Document / Project Summary detailing: design description, changes to the original design, and the test plan. Functionally, the user controls a character that moves around inside of a 2D text-based set of rooms. These rooms are linked together by doors that point to other rooms. The user can pick up or drop objects into or from a limited inventory bag. The user can also affect his or her surroundings by flipping switches inside of certain rooms.

This program was initially written to be run in Windows but can be modified to run well in Linux. Simply implement the few changes listed at the end of the reflection document.
